			<h3>Jason Shatz<span class="title">(Founder, Director of Business Development)</span></h3>

			<p>J.D. Shatz founded Bridgebuilder in 2016 after searching, to no avail, for initiatives that would address America’s crumbling infrastructure.  Having grown up in New Jersey, he experienced the effects firsthand and decided to do something about it.</p>

			<p>Shatz was previously a writer and researcher in various forums, and he still writes from time to time.  He is also preoccupied with learning the code that will help bring his many ideas to life.  
			</p>

			<p>
				Currently studying web development at the New York Code and Design Academy, he holds a B.A. in Government and Writing from Wesleyan University.
