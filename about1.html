      <p>At Bridgebuilder, we do not refer to our organization as a disruptor.  For we work in spaces that have been disrupted by rapid rates of decay.</p>

      <p>As a non-profit, we focus on two interrelated institutions whose utility and fungibility have declined to our nation's detriment.  The first is a crumbling <b>infrastructure</b>, once a crown jewel of a bustling America.  

      <p>The second is our <b>politics</b>, as exemplified by voters' declining trust in elected officials.  In one of many notable and troubling patterns of stasis, infrastructure spending has stalled across the nation.  Politicians and voters whose views range across the political spectrum agree that maintaining our infrastructure is a key government priority.  And yet transportation trust funds on both state and national levels run dry. </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Americans continue to use our nation's aging transit and water systems.  We suffer the consequences - tires blown by potholes, delayed commutes, health hazards, and even lost lives. </p>

      <p>We do not really need to <i>disrupt</i> these trends, for they are <b>disruptors</b> of trends that ought to sustain our nation.  Indeed, Bridgebuilder aims to live up to its name, to repair the systems that make the backbone of a strong society.</p>

      <p>Our objective is to:
        <ul>
        <li>Allow citizens to voice their concerns on the state of our nation's aging infrastructure, and to call to the attention of the powers that be - from local and federal governments to the contractors that work with them - the urgency of the issue.</li>
        <li>Foster the partnerships that will speed infrastructure reform through bureaucratic obstacles and governmental stasis.</li>
        <li>Help offer taxpayers a sense that their tax dollars really are being put to work.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>We intend to address these aims through two mechanisms.</p>

      <p>The first is an app that will allow you to report a problem, second the report, and view other reported issues on a map.  As more and more people report the same problem, it will appear on our map with increasingly harsh reminders, like so: </p>

        <!--A set of rough-draft images that represent the increasing urgency of the problem.-->

        </div>

      <p>This will highlight how urgent the problem is, to governments, contractors, and the public alike.</p>

      <p>The second is a non-profit arm.  We will work with local, state, and national governments, along with other appropriate entities, to expedite the process of maintaining and improving America's infrastructure.  And we will also allow citizens to make tax-deductible payments to the infrastructure projects of their choice.
